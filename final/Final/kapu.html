    <h2>The Kapu System: Sacred Laws</h2>
    <p>Before 1819, kapu governed all aspects of Hawaiian life, connecting aliʻi (chiefs), kahuna (priests), and makaʻāinana (commoners) through spiritual and social order.</p>

    <h2>What Was Kapu?</h2>
    <p>Kapu means "forbidden" or "set apart." It created harmony between people, gods, and nature. Examples: women couldn't eat pork or bananas, commoners couldn't let shadows touch aliʻi, fishing had seasonal restrictions.</p>
    <p>Violating kapu brought severe punishment, often death, because it disrupted spiritual balance (mana). Heiau temples enforced religious kapu through rituals and offerings.</p>

    <h2>End of Kapu (Ai Noa)</h2>
    <p>In 1819, Kamehameha II (Liholiho) broke kapu by eating with women at a feast called ʻAi Noa (free eating). This ended the traditional religion and opened doors for Christianity.</p>
    <p>The shift allowed new social freedoms but also rapid Western influence on Hawaiian society and governance.</p>
