    <h2>Historical Overview</h2>
    <p>Hawaiʻi was settled by Polynesian voyagers who arrived by voyaging canoe and developed a distinct society, including aliʻi (chiefs), kapu (sacred laws), and highly organized systems of land and resource management.</p>
    <p>Later, contact with Western powers, the rise of the sugar economy, and political pressure led to the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom and eventual annexation to the United States.</p>
