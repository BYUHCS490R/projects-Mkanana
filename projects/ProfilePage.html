    <h1>Micah Kanana</h1>
    <p>Howzit, my name is Micah Kanana I was born on the island of Oahu on the west side of the island known as <strong>Waianae</strong>. I was raised in Waianae for my entire life, but I did not go to school out there. I went to a school called Kawaihona in Nanakuli. Later, I transfered schools and graduated at Kamehameha Schools KapƒÅlama. </p>
    <p>One of my favorite things to do in my free time is to play ukulele with friends or by myself or go to the beach and have fun. Some things I like to do at the beach is to go bomb. Some of you might not know what bombing even is. But to simplify it down. Its like cliff jumping. We like to see who can make the biggest bomb or splash.</p>

    <h2>Favorite places to go bomb</h2>
